# brigx-theme

The essential files for the custom Wordpress theme of our website (http://brigx.it), based on the free Wordpress theme "Edin" (https://theme.wordpress.com/themes/edin/) by Automattic.

## Installation

As this is a child theme, in order to use it you must first install Edin.

After both themes are in your "themes" directory, you can activate this one.

## Localization

Edin offers translations for many languages, but not Italian. As we are an Italian Linux Users Group, we chose to localize Edin in our language too. The .po/.mo files are in the "languages" folder, but you will probabily have to move them to Edin's own folder in order to make them work for you.
